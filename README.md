# StockMarket_Q_Learning
Implemented Deep Q-Learning agent that can perform unsupervised stock trading
The aim of this project is to train an agent that uses Q-learning and neural networks to predict the profit or loss by building a model and implementing it on a dataset that is available for evaluation.

The stock trading index environment provides the agent with a set of actions:
 * Buy
 * Sell
 * Sit- (The agent doesn't buy or sell any stock for that duration)
